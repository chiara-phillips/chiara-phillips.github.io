I made this map as part of the Copernicus Marine Service Data Viz Webinar Series. I am terrified of public speaking, but I found it really rewarding after to share my process with you all. I feel like it does more justice to the map itself instead of letting it dust off in the back of my computer somewhere. :)


I hope you try it out for yourself- I'd love to see your plankton maps!
