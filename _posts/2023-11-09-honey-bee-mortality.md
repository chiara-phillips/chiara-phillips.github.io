The theme for Day 9 of the 2023 #30daymapchallenge was "hexagons" so you know I had to make a map for bees. 💛 🖤

Why do honey bees get so much press?

🐝 Honey bees are critical to agricultural ecosystems. They pollinate many of the flowers of fruits, vegetables and nuts we eat!

🐝 The U.S. annual honey bee colony mortality rate has fluctuated between 30-45%, with some beekeepers losing over half of their colonies every year.
