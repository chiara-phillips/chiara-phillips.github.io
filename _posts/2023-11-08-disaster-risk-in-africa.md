Have you heard of the "World Risk Index" yet? It's a statistical model that quantifies global disaster risks based on the interactions between extreme "natural" events, social inequalities, disaster preparedness, and more. It is updated annually by the Institut für Friedenssicherungsrecht und Humanitäres Völkerrecht (IFHV) and Bündnis Entwicklung Hilft.

I created this choropleth map for the 2023 #30daymapchallenge for the theme, "Africa".
