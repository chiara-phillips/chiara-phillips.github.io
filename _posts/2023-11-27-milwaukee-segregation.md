## Description
"In the past, map-makers used to use maps to restrict opportunity. Today, we need to focus on race in our maps to create equity in our world. ... All of us have heard that change takes time. I disagree. Change takes action."
-Clinton G. Johnson, Antiracist Geospatial Architect

I grew up in Milwaukee, which is one of the most segregated cities in the United States. Segregation does not happen by accident. Discriminatory practices such as redlining and racial convenants have shaped the racial distribution of cities across the U.S., my hometown included.
