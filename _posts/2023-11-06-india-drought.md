# About this map
This map is typical of maps I created during my time as a cartographer and geospatial analyst for the USDA Foreign Agricultural Service. In my time there, we used GIS and remote sensing with tabular and geospatial data to make quick-turnaround maps about pressing stories related to agriculture. There, I learned the value of prepping datasets, layouts, and styles ahead of time, and began my interest in map automation.

We had strict style specifications and were on tight deadlines. I found it very exciting!

I created this map using UCSB CHIRPS data within QGIS and Canva during the #30DayMapChallenge in 2023 after work one day. I think sometimes people see my work and think I only do in-depth maps, but creating a quick story or quick visual has been an enjoyable and repeated part of my work for many years now, both at my time with USDA but also now at Seqana!
