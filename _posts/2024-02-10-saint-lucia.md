After a restful holiday season and lots of time to soak in new inspiration, I decided to create a map about Saint Lucia, where one of my friends is currently conducting research to support small-holder farmers in adapting to climate change. The styling is a re-creation of the look and feel of a National Geographic South America reference map I saw recently.

Steps:
- Exported NASA SRTM's Digital Elevation Model layer from Google Earth Engine
- Created hillshade layer in QGIS
- Stylized the administrative layers with a shapeburst fill
- Stylized the oceans by using an inverted polygon shapeburst fill layer with a glow effect
- Edited river lines for cleanliness, visualized by river size
- Added labels and text in Canva
## Tools Used
Google Earth Engine, QGIS, Canva

## Data Source
Natural Earth, Humanitarian Data Exchange, NASA SRTM
