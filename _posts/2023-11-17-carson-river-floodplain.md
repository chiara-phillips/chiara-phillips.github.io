This map was on my "map creation wishlist" for so long! What you see here is a relative elevation model (REM).

REMs detrend the baseline elevation of a digital elevation model to start at the river surface instead of at sea level. This is particularly helpful when you want to discern current/historical river features- or when you want to create something that looks mega-cool. üòÅ

Shout out to Dan Coe for a wonderful tutorial on how to create these types of maps!
