Have you ever seen a world map like this? ðŸ”Ž

Because the earth is a globe, maps have to distort the earth in some way to be presented on a 2D surface. Each of these "ways of distorting" are what we GIS-folk call "map projections".

The projection shown here is the ðŸŒŠ SPILHAUS PROJECTION ðŸŒŠ, which is handy for seeing all of the world's oceans (ocean?) in one place. I love that this projection forces us to realize how connected the oceans really are.

I created this map as part of the 2023 #30daymapchallenge, combining the themes "Raster" and "North Isn't Always Up" into one map.
