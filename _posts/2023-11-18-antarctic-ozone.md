After discovering that CFCs were damaging the ozone layer in the 1980s, countries around the world agreed to ban them. As a result, the ozone layer is slowly healing (with some fluctuations due to seasonality, wildfires, volcanic eruptions). While the ozone layer still won't be restored to its pre-industrial levels for several decades, this story gives me so much hope. It shows that global climate action is absolutely possible if we all prioritize it TODAY!

I heard a great quote from Sophia Kianni recently: "I wish I could say that someone was going to save us. But we really have to save ourselves."
