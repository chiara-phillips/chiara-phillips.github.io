One of the many things I love about Berlin is how much excitement there is around lake season in the summer. The winters are oppressively dark but as soon as temperatures rise in the spring, everyone runs to the nearest lake for a swim! There's a very similar reverence for lakes in Wisconsin, where I grew up.

For the #30daymapchallenge theme "polygon," I wanted to see what Berlin's neighborhoods would look like if they were based on which lake they were closest to. I hope you enjoy it and appreciate a lake today! üòÅ

These shapes are called Thiessen/Voronoi polygons- AKA the two hardest GIS terms for me to pronounce! ü§£ (If you can think of some GIS terms that are harder to pronounce you get extra credit.) The Thiessen/Voronoi polygon tools split an area into regions based on each region's proximity to an input point layer.
