Expansion of Airbnb listings in Prague from 2010-2023. Only listings with at least one review for a given year were included.

You can see that most of the Airbnbs are concentrated around and grow in Prague’s city center.

I was inspired to create this after a recent trip to Prague and stumbling upon a beautiful and informative hex bin map animation from Nelson Schäfer!
